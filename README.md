# JARVIS-The-Virtual-Assistant




Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have your own A.I. assistant? Imagine how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command. In this tutorial, I will teach you how you can make your personal A.I. assistant using Python. 

As we know Python is an emerging language so it becomes easy to write a script for Voice
Assistant in Python. The instructions for the assistant can be handled as per the requirement
of user. Speech recognition is the process of converting speech into text. This is commonly
used in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc. In Python there is an API called
SpeechRecognition which allows us to convert speech into text. It was an interesting task
to make my own assistant. It became easier to send emails without typing any word,
Searching on Google without opening the browser, and performing many other daily tasks
like playing music, opening your favorite IDE with the help of a single voice command. In
the current scenario, advancement in technologies are such that they can perform any task
with same effectiveness or can say more effectively than us. By making this project, I
realized that the concept of AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time.
Functionalities of this project include:
1. It can send emails.
2. It can read PDF.
3. It can send text on WhatsApp.
4. It can open command prompt, your favorite IDE, notepad etc.
5. It can play music.
6. It can do Wikipedia searches for you.
7. It can open websites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a web browser.
8. It can give weather forecast.
9. It can give desktop reminders of your choice.
10. It can have some basic conversation.
